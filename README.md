Stock Scraper (GoLang)
This project scrapes stock data from Yahoo Finance using GoLang, providing a foundation for analysis and exploration.

Features:

Extracts company name, price, and change percentage for specified tickers.
Writes scraped data to a CSV file for easy access and manipulation.
Handles errors gracefully, including network issues, HTML parsing errors, and CSV writing mistakes.
Adaptable design to account for potential changes in Yahoo Finance's structure.
Project Structure:

main.go: Contains the main logic for scraping and writing data to CSV.
errors.go: (Optional) Defines custom error types for better error handling.
utils.go: (Optional) Houses utility functions for common tasks.
stocks.csv: Output file generated with the scraped data.
Prerequisites:

GoLang installed (https://golang.org/)
colly Go package (https://github.com/gocolly/colly)
Installation:

Clone this repository: git clone [repository URL]
Install colly: go get -u github.com/gocolly/colly
Usage:

Configure tickers: Edit the ticker slice in main.go with your desired company abbreviations.
Customize output: Change the CSV field names by modifying the headers slice in main.go.
Run the program: go run main.go
Access results: The scraped data will be written to stocks.csv.
Additional Notes:

This project is for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use without further enhancements (e.g., rate limiting, advanced error handling).
Be mindful of scraping limits and terms of service when using third-party websites.
Consider security risks associated with external data sources and user input in production environments.
Enhancements:

Expand scraping to include additional data points (e.g., market cap, P/E ratio, historical data).
Implement parallel scraping for faster processing, especially with many tickers.
Refactor the code for better organization, modularity, and maintainability.
Add command-line arguments for easier customization and user-friendliness.
Remember:

Replace [repository URL] with the actual URL of your repository.
If you create custom error types and utility functions, update the project structure accordingly.
